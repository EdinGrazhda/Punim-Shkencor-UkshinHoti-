# CkaDinTi

Desktop-first AI classroom quiz platform with PostgreSQL persistence.

Read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for repository rules and [docs/TEAM_TASKS.md](docs/TEAM_TASKS.md) for the non-overlapping branch ownership plan.

## Branches

- `Arron` - teacher desktop, lesson ingestion, AI generation, quiz review, and teacher reports.
- `Edin` - student browser, LAN game host, realtime protocol, authoritative scoring, and runtime analytics.

The supplied deep-research report is the original product brief. The team has since selected PostgreSQL instead of its SQLite recommendation; see [docs/DEPENDENCIES.md](docs/DEPENDENCIES.md). Graphify is an optional visualization integration; RTK is the required token-efficient CLI workflow.
